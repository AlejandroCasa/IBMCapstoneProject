    "\n",
    "Madrid and Barcelona are the 2 largest cities in Spain. While Madrid is the capital of the country and historically is much older, Barcelona grew a lot from the 19th century. Currently, between the two cities there is a great rivalry both politically, economically and sportingly. For this reason, and for being the two cities in which I have lived the longest, I have decided to compare them.\n"

    "Data science has a potential to tell us what people won't be able to notice and what is not written in books or magazines. The aim of this project is to provide new insights to tourists who are interested in Spain or to travel agencies who publish books or provide information on the internet.\n"

    "\n",
    "As I have said before, Madrid is the capital of Spain. It is known for being the largest city in Spain and the most populated. It is divided into 22 districts. On the other hand, Barcelona is an important merchant port and a great tourist destination. Barcelona is divided into 10 districts. I will use clustering analysis methodology for each district. In addition, below is basic comparison of Madrid and Barcelona, which could complement the results of data analysis (although I won't use these info in Python programming).\n",
